##Description
This is a simple pebble watch app to read accelerometer data from the watch. I am doing this to learn more about how sensors in modern devices work and how to properly use them.

## Usage
1. Install Pebble SDK on your PC.
2. Build the app using `pebble build`.
3. Install on watch using `pebble install --logs`(the logs option will display the accelerometer data on your PC in realtime.)
